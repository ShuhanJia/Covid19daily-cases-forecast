develop a predictive model to forecast the daily confirmedcases of COVID-19 of a country given its historical daily confirmed cases. 

Hi I am Shuhan! A uni student studying Finance and Business Analytics.

This is from one of my uni assignment, I am happy that my team and I finished this project! We did well in both coding and report writing. 

I would like to share the code with people, and also to record what I learnt in uni. Hope I can make more progress in coding dand data analyzing!
